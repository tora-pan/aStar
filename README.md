# A* Path finding algorithm visualizer

Made with React

## Visualize

This will run an animation. Behind the scenes it is finding the shortest possible route from Green to Red.
If a path is found, it will animate the path after checking all of the nodes.

## Reset
Reset just clears the nodes so you can re-watch the animation.

### Refreshing (the browser)
This will reset the randomly generated walls (black) to see a new shortest path.
